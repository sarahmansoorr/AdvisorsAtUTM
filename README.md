# AdvisorsAtUTM
Calculated the average amount of students that visit each type of advisor
at the registrar's office (Academic, Financial, Success) by collecting data
from the Universities webpage using a specialized script in Python over 28 days.

Wrote a written report to summarize the results (most students visited the
Academic advisor in the sampling frame), any limitation or qualifications,
and any implications that may be useful to the University.
